Project Stages
1. Data Preprocessing
The initial dataset was explored and preprocessed to ensure the data's quality and usability. Missing values were handled through imputation or removal, and data types were checked and converted where necessary.
2. Analysis and Visualization
The analysis and visualization stages focused on various aspects of bike rentals, including:

Rental Trends Along Various Seasons
Exploration of how bike rentals vary across different seasons, identifying patterns and trends.

More Analysis on Rental Trends Along Various Seasons
Further insights and visualizations on rental trends, providing deeper understanding.

Weekly and Daily Patterns for Rentals
Analysis of rental patterns on a weekly and daily basis to uncover usage patterns.

Daily Demand and Weekly Demand
Examination of daily and weekly demand trends to identify peak usage times.

Demand Analysis for Holiday vs. Non-Holiday Rentals
Comparative analysis of bike rental demand on holidays and regular days.

Hourly Patterns
Investigation of rental patterns on an hourly basis to understand usage throughout the day.

How the Weather Affects the Rental Patterns
Exploration of the correlation between weather conditions and bike rental patterns.

Analysis of Bike Rental and Solar Radiation
Insights into how solar radiation affects bike rental trends.

Effect of Weather on Rental Pattern
Further analysis on how weather conditions impact rental patterns, revealing potential relationships.
3. Handling Outliers Using Boxplot
Outliers in the dataset were identified and visualized using boxplots. This step helped in understanding the distribution of data and identifying potential extreme values that could affect the analysis.

4. Remove Outliers
Outliers identified using the boxplot analysis were removed from the dataset. This process ensured that extreme values do not unduly influence the subsequent analysis and model training.

5. Scaling
Features in the dataset were scaled using StandardScaler to ensure that all features have similar scales. Scaling is important for algorithms that are sensitive to the magnitude of features.

6. Feature Selection
To identify the most relevant features for predicting bike rental counts, feature importance was determined using techniques like Random Forest regression and SelectKBest.

7. Model Training
A Random Forest regression model was trained using the selected features. This model has the ability to capture complex relationships between the features and the target variable.
